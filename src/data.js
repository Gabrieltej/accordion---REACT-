    title: 'Do I need to change my page password?',
    info: `It is generally recommended to change your passwords for websites and online accounts periodically, as a security measure. This is because if your password is compromised, an attacker may be able to gain access to your account and any sensitive information stored within it.

    The frequency with which you should change your passwords may vary depending on the specific website or account, as well as your own personal security preferences. Some security experts recommend changing your passwords every 90 days, while others suggest doing so annually or even less frequently.

    In addition to changing your passwords periodically, you should also ensure that you are using strong and unique passwords for each of your online accounts. This means avoiding common or easily guessable passwords, such as "password" or "123456," and instead using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. You can also consider using a password manager to help you generate and manage strong passwords for all of your accounts.
